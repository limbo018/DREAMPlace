#NCTU-GR 2.0 is designed by Wen-Hao Liu. Last updated 2012/04/14
#All values in this file must be integer
Via Cost = 1					# It must be >=1
Wirelength Optimization Level = 10 # It must be set between 1 and 500. The wirelength of routing result is shorter as this value is larger.
Layer Assignment Algorithm = 2 # 1: greedy LA  2: dynamic-programming-based LA 3: negotiation-based LA
Output Routing Result = Yes # Yes or No
Output Overflow Information = Yes # Yes or No
Ignored Net Threshold = -1 # The nets with g-pins > the given threshold are ignored. If the given threshold is set to -1, all nets will be routed.
Pin Blockage Factor = 0.0 # It must be >=0.0

# The routing iteration of each stage
Pattern Routing Iteration = 1		# It must be >=1
Monotonic Routing Iteration = 1	# It must be >=0
Maze Routing Iteration = 1		# If it is set to -1, the maze routing stage finishes when overflows = 0
Post Routing Iteration = 1		# It must be >=0. If the inputed benchmark is hard-to-route, it can be set larger than 2.
3D Optimization Iteration = 0		# It must be >=0

####### Following utilities will be provided in future ######
# Light Mode = Yes # Yes or No
# Layer Directives = No
# Scenic Control = No
# Overflow Elimination Iteration = 0	# It must be >=0, If the inputed benchmark is hard-to-route, it can be set larger than 4.
# Thread number on Multi-Core Platform = 1
# Acceleration using GPU = No
