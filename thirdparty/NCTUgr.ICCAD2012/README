README

== Contest Execution Command ==
./NCTUgr DAC <circuit.aux> <solution.pl> <parameter setting file> [output file]

circuit.aux            : Benchmark auxiliary file
solution.pl            : Solution .pl file from the placer
parameter setting file : "DAC12.set" (Settings for the DAC-2012 contest)
output file            : Output file to dump the global routing solution

== Contest Release Version ==
NCTU-GR 2.0 - CRV2.1

== NOTES ==
1) "DAC12.set" is the default parameter setting file for the DAC-2012 contest.

2) All the files associated with the router (listed above) should be present 
   in the run directory.

3) The benchmark and solution.pl files may be present in a different directory.

4) Alternate/general execution command:
   ./NCTUgr DAC <benchmark_dir/circuit.aux> <solution_dir/solution.pl> DAC12.set [Output file]
